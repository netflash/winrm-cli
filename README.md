# winrm-cli

This is a Go command-line executable to execute remote commands on Windows machines through
the use of WinRM/WinRS.

_Note_: this tool doesn't support domain users (it doesn't support GSSAPI nor Kerberos). It's primary target is to execute remote commands on EC2 windows machines.

## Getting Started
WinRM is available on Windows Server 2008 and up. This project natively supports basic authentication for local accounts, see the steps in the next section on how to prepare the remote Windows machine for this scenario. The authentication model is pluggable, see below for an example on using Negotiate/NTLM authentication (e.g. for connecting to vanilla Azure VMs).

### Preparing the remote Windows machine for Basic authentication
This project supports only basic authentication for local accounts (domain users are not supported). The remote windows system must be prepared for winrm:

_For a PowerShell script to do what is described below in one go, check [Richard Downer's blog](http://www.frontiertown.co.uk/2011/12/overthere-control-windows-from-java/)_

On the remote host, a PowerShell prompt, using the __Run as Administrator__ option and paste in the following lines:

    winrm quickconfig
    y
    winrm set winrm/config/service/Auth '@{Basic="true"}'
    winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
    winrm set winrm/config/winrs '@{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="1024"}'

__N.B.:__ The Windows Firewall needs to be running to run this command. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base article #2004640](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2004640).

__N.B.:__ Do not disable Negotiate authentication as the windows `winrm` command itself uses this for internal authentication, and you risk getting a system where `winrm` doesn't work anymore.

__N.B.:__ The `MaxMemoryPerShellMB` option has no effects on some Windows 2008R2 systems because of a WinRM bug. Make sure to install the hotfix described [Microsoft Knowledge Base article #2842230](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2842230) if you need to run commands that uses more than 150MB of memory.

### Building the winrm-cli executable

You can build winrm-cli from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/masterzen/winrm-cli
cd winrm-cli
make
```

This will generate a binary in the base directory called `./winrm`.

_Note_: you need go 1.5+. Please check your installation with

```
go version
```

## Command-line usage

Once built, you can run remote commands like this:

```sh
./winrm -hostname remote.domain.com -username "Administrator" -password "secret" "ipconfig /all"
```

## Docker

### Build container

```
docker build -t winrm .
```

### Usage

Once build, you can run remote commands like this:

```sh
docker run -it --rm winrm winrm -hostname remote.domain.com -username "Administrator" -password "secret" "ipconfig /all"
```
